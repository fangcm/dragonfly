            <Text><![CDATA[As an experienced photojournalist in Nashville, Tennessee, I was hired by USA Today newspaper to photograph a spinal bifida (脊柱畸形) corrective surgical procedure. It was to be performed on a twenty-one week old fetus（胎儿） in uterus（子宫） at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. At that time, in 1999, twenty-one weeks in uterus was the earliest that the surgical team would consider for surgery. The worst possible outcome would be that the surgery would cause premature delivery, and no child born earlier than twenty-three weeks had survived. 
The tension could be felt in the operating room as the surgery began. A typical C-section incision(切口) was made to access the uterus, which was then lifted out and laid at the junction of the mother's thighs. The entire procedure would take place within the uterus, and no part of the child was to breach the surgical opening. During the procedure, the position of the fetus was adjusted by gently manipulating the outside of the uterus. The entire surgical procedure on the child was completed in one hour and thirteen minutes. When it was over, the surgical team breathed a sigh of relief, as did I. 
As a doctor asked me what speed of film I was using, out of the corner of my eye I saw the uterus shake, but no one's hands were near it. It was shaking from within. Suddenly, an entire arm thrust out of the opening, then pulled back until just a little hand was showing. The doctor reached over and lifted the hand, which reacted and squeezed the doctor's finger. As if testing for strength, the doctor shook the tiny fist. Samuel held firm. I took the picture! Wow! It happened so fast that the nurse standing next to me asked, "What happened?" "The child reached out," I said. "Oh. They do that all the time," she responded. 
The surgical opening to the uterus was closed and the uterus was then put back into the mother and the C-section opening was closed.
It was ten days before I knew if the picture was even in focus. To ensure no digital manipulation of images before they see them, USA Today requires that film be submitted unprocessed. When the photo editor finally phoned me he said, "It's the most incredible picture I've ever seen."

            <Text><![CDATA[Losing a baby tooth can be fun for a kid. You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent(永恒的) tooth grow in its place.
But if a permanent tooth falls out, that’s a problem. There isn’t another one under the gum(齿龈)that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out or need to be pulled, an older person might need dentures.
Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth.
Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked（浸泡） in denture solution when not in the mouth.
Dentures are important for the old because, without teeth, it’s hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little weird if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won’t have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings.
People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease（牙周炎）, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren’t strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities(洞)that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth problems.

            <Text><![CDATA[One of the world's richest men has taken a close interest in one of man's most basic functions: visiting the toilet．Bill Gates's charitable organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is looking for inventors to design the lop of the future, which, they hope, would improve sanitation for millions of people around the world． So, what's wrong with the traditional flush toilet? Firstly, it wastes a huge amount of potential drinking water．Secondly, they are more likely to cause pollution．This is a real problem in many areas of the developing world, where, according to United Nations estimates, unsafe sanitation causes half of all hospitalizations．Younger people are particularly at risk．Illnesses which cause diarrhea are responsible for the deaths of about 1．5 million children a year．Finally, standard lavatories simply aren't practical in remote areas．The challenge set by Bill Gates was to come up with a latrine which works without running water, electricity or aseptic tank．It also needed to operate for less than 5 cents．28 designs were displayed at the recent fienivenf the Toilet Fair in Seattle, USA．Among them was one which turned human waste into electricity using microwaves, another which converted human waste into charcoal, and yet another which used urine for flushing．But the winner was a solar-powered design which generated hydrogen gas and electricity． The team from the California Institute of Technology （CIT） picked up a prize of $ 100,000.But clearly Bill Gates doesn't feel he's flushing money down the toilet．After the Seattle event he said, "We, couldn't be happier with the response we've gotten," Gates has even pledged $3 70m more to the future toilet project．They hope to field test more, prototypes over the next three years．]]></Text>

            <Text><![CDATA[On a BA flight from Johannesburg, a middle-aged, well-off white South African Lady has found herself sitting next to a black man. She called a stewardess (女乘务员) over to complain about her seating. “What seems to be the problem, Madam?” asked the stewardess. “Can’t you see?” she said, “You’ve sat me next to a kafir（异教徒）. I can’t possibly sit next to this disgusting man. Find me another seat!” “Please calm down, Madam,” the stewardess replied. “The flight is very full today, but I’ll tell you what I’ll do - I’ll go and check to see if we have any seats available in club or first class.”The woman cocked a snooty（傲慢的） look at the black man beside her. A few minutes later the stewardess returned with the good news, which she delivered to the lady, who could not help but look at the people around her with a smug and self-satisfied grin. “Madam, unfortunately, as I suspected, economy is full. I’ve spoken to the cabin services director, and club is also full. However, we do have one seat in first class.”Before the lady had a chance to answer, the stewardess continued, “It is the most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade, however, and I have had to get special permission from the captain. But, given the circumstances, the captain felt that it was outrageous（令人不能容忍的） that someone should be forced to sit next to such an obnoxious（讨厌的） person.” Having said that, the stewardess turned to the black man sitting next to the lady, and said, “So if you’d like to get your things, sir, I have your seat ready for you.” At that point, the surrounding passengers stood up and gave an ovation（喝彩） while the black man walked up to the front of the plane. ]]></Text>

Edwin gave the girls footballs and rifles, while Amy shocked the community by dressing them in gym suits instead of skirts. Edwin's job caused the family to move from town to town, and the girls’ interest in rough sports and shooting rats raised eyebrows wherever they went.    Amelia's parents did not pressure her to reform as she grew older, even when she dabbled（轻率地对待） in the domains of science and automobile mechanics. But in 1920, when she went aloft（在空中） at an air show and returned home determined to learn how to fly, even her liberal Parents hesitated.

Although my thoughts were only on speed, the checkout line I was standing in wasn’t moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier.There stood a man in his seventies, wearing glasses and a nice smile. I thought, well, he’s an old guy!For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before scanning the items. Sure, his words were the usual, “How’s it going?” But he did something different----he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation.I thought it was odd. I have grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don’t give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, “I just found out I have six months to live,” and someone would reply, “Have a great day!”But that wasn’t the end.He gave them the change, walked around the counter, and extended his right hand in an act of friendship. He looked the customers in the eyes. “I sure want to thank you for shopping here today,” he told them. “You have a great day. Bye-bye.”The looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some sheepish grins. All had been touched by his simple gesture and in a place they never expected. They would gather their things and walk out, smiling.Of course, he did the same to me and I got to know his name. Marty.Who was that guy? It was as if Sam Walton had come back from the dead and invaded this old guy’s body.I had never walked away from that shop feeling like that.]]></Text>

            <Text><![CDATA[Scientists have recently discovered that mothers tend to hold their baby on the left. Of 255 right-handed mothers 83% held the baby on the left. And out of 32 left-handed women 78% held the baby on the left. As a control women were watched coming from supermarkets carrying baby-sized bags; the bags were held with no side preference. 
Then dental patients were given a large rubber ball to hold during treatment. The majority held the ball to their left side even when it interfered with the dentist's activities. This suggested that in times of stress objects are held against the left side. 
At that point something clearly contrary was observed. A large number of mothers who brought their premature (早产的) babies to a clinic were seen to hold their babies against their right side. 
So 115 mothers who had been separated from their babies for 24 hours after birth were observed for holding response. The experimenters presented the baby directly to midline of the mother's body and noted how she held the baby. 53% placed the baby on the left and 47% on the right. And it was also noted that the mothers of the group who had held their baby on the left had already had a baby from which they had not been separated after birth. 
Left-handed holding enables the baby to hear the heartbeat. In order to discover whether hearing the heart has a beneficial effect on the baby, the sound of a human heart-beat was played to 102 babies in a New York nursery for 4 days. A control group of babies was not exposed to heart-beats. The babies in the heart-beat group gained more weight and cried far less than the babies in the control group.

            <Text><![CDATA[From a very early age, some children show better self-control than others. Now, a new study that began with about 1,000 children in New Zealand has tracked how a child’s low self-control can predict poor health, money troubles and even a criminal record in their adult years.
Researchers have been studying this group of children for decades now. They observed the level of self-control the youngsters displayed. Parents, teachers, even the kids themselves, scored the youngsters on measures like “acting before thinking” and “Persistence in reaching goals.”
The study led  by Moffitt of Duke University and colleagues followed 1,000 children from birth to age 32 in Dunedin, New Zealand.
“The children who had the lowest self-control when they were age three to ten, later on had the most health problems in their 30s,” Moffitt said，“and they had the worst financial situation. They were more likely to have a criminal record and to be raising a child as a single parent on a very low income.” Moffitt explained that self-control problems were widely observed, and weren’t just a feature of a small group of misbehaving kids.
Moffitt said it’s still unclear why some children have better self-control than others, though she said other researchers have found that it’s mostly a learned behavior, with relatively little genetic influence. But good self-control can be set to run in families because children with good self-control are more likely to grow up to be healthy and prosperous parents. But the good news, Moffitt said, is that self-control can be taught by parents, and through school curricula that have been shown to be effective.

            <Text><![CDATA[“Our aim is to take our art to the world and make people understand what it is to move,” said David Belle, the founder of parkour(跑酷).
Do you love running? It is a good exercise, yet many people find it boring. But what if making your morning jog a creative one? Like jumping from walls and over gaps, and ground rolls? Just like the James Bond in the movie Casino Royale? Bond jumps down from a roof to a windowsill and then runs several blocks over obstacles on the way. It is just because of Bond’s wonderful performances that the sport has become popular worldwide.
Yes, that’s parkour, an extreme street sport aimed at moving from one point to another as quickly as possible, getting over all the obstacles in the path using only the abilities of the human body. Parkour is considered an extreme sport. As its participants dash around a city, they may jump over fences, run up walls and even move from rooftop to rooftop. 
Parkour can be just as exciting and charming as it sounds, but its participants see parkour much more than that.
Overcoming all the obstacles on the course and in life is part of the philosophy(理念) behind parkour. This is the same as life. You must determine your destination, go straight, jump over all the barriers as if in parkour and never fall back from them in your life, to reach the destination successfully. A parkour lover said, “I love parkour because its philosophy has become my life, my way to do everything.”
Another philosophy we’ve learnt from parkour is freedom. It can be done by anyone, at any time, anywhere in the world. It is a kind of expression of trust in yourself that you earn energy and confidence.

            <Text><![CDATA[Henry Ford, American car manufacturer, founded the Ford Car Company and produced Type T cars. He succeeded in making America a big car country.
    Growing up on a far-away Michigan farm, Henry Ford knew little of farming -- but he soon showed signs that he belonged to a new generation of Americans interested more in the industrial future than in the agricultural past. His father, William, hoped that his eldest son would join him on the farm enable it to become larger, and at last, take it over. But Henry hated farm work and did everything he could to avoid it. It was not that he was lazy. Far from it. Give him a mechanical job to do and he would set to work eagerly. It was the daily life of the farm, with its repetitive tasks, that frustrated him. "What a waste it is," he wrote years later, remembering his work in the fields, "for a human being to spend hours and days behind a slowly moving team of horses."
   So Henry turned his attention elsewhere. When he was twelve, he became interested in clocks and watches. Soon he was repairing clocks and watches for friends, working at a bench he built in his bedroom. In 1876, Henry left the farm, and three years later, he took a job as a mechanic in Detroit. By this time steam engines had joined clocks and watches as objects of Henry's fascination.
   According to Henry himself, he first saw a steam-driven road engine one day in 1877 when he and his father, in their horse-drawn farm wagon, met one on the road. The engine driver stopped to let the wagon pass, and Henry jumped down and went to him with many technical questions about the engine's performance. From then on, for a while, Henry became fascinated with steam engines.
   A chance meeting with an old co-worker led to a job for Henry as an engineer at the Edison
Detroit Electricity Company, the leading force in another new industry. Power stations were being built and cables being laid in all of the United States' major cities; the age of electricity had begun. But although Henry quickly learned the rules for his new job -- so quickly that within four years he was the chief engineer at the Detroit power plant -- his interest in fuel engines had control of his life. At first in the kitchen, and later in a shed at the back of his house, he spent his spare time in the evenings trying to build an engine to his own design.
   Henry learned it was a slow, hard business to build an engine by hand. Every piece of every part had to be made separately, checked and rechecked, and tested. Every problem had to be worried over and solved by the builder. To ease the burden, Henry joined forces with another mechanic, Jim Bishop. Even so, it was two years before they had succeeded in building a working car. It was a simple one, fixed on bicycle wheels and driven by a rubber belt that connected the engine to the back wheels. Henry called it the "Quadricycle".

A British-made computer game on trial release on Monday creates different ways of doing just that．
“Fate of the World”puts the Earth’s future in players’ hands, placing them in charge of an international environmental body which could save the world from the effects of rising greenhouse gas emissions（排放）or let it destroyed by more emissions．
	Through different scenes, players can explore options such as geoengineering（地球工程） and alternative energy sources to save the planet from rising temperatures, decreasing natural resources and a growing population over the next 200 years．
	An improved version of the game will be followed by a three-month feedback period from players, with final release due in February next year．
	Created by Oxford-based games developer Red Redemption, the game is different from other mainstream action games mainly by using data from real climate models and advice from scientists and economists．
“Science data is often inaccessible and we are trying to put players in a position of power and connected with the issues,” Gobion Rowlands, Red Redemption’s founder and chairman said．
This year, a series of apparent errors in climate science and the failure of UN talks to reach an international deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions appeared to weaken the public’s interest in climate change．
However, games centered on sustainability（持续性）and human rights have been growing in popularity and are welcomed by green groups as a way of raising awareness．
Using climate change as inspiration for entertainment shows the issue has affected global culture, which can only be a good thing．Friends of the Earth's head of climate Mike Childs said.“We need creative industries to work with these big issues as the results can be extremely powerful and can help us to understand what a sustainable future looks and feels like,”he added．

            <Text><![CDATA[Credit cards let people buy things now and pay for them over months or even years. But some people get deep into debt: Some banks have terms and charges that can make it harder for people to pay off that debt. In the United States, there are calls for stronger government supervision of the credit card industry. They offer economic power at a price. In 2004, Americans had about $800 billion in credit card debt. Now they own about $968 billion.
Critics say banks made it too easy to get credit cards. But that may be changing. The crisis in the housing and credit they call markets is beginning to affect the credit card industry. More payments are late. Charges for late payments are a growing source of profit for banks. But late payments can also signal bad debts.
The central bank, the Federal Reserve, says two-thirds of American banks have recently reported tighter lending requirements. Many people report having their credit limits reduced without warning.
Some lawmakers are concerned that cardholders do not have enough protections from what abusive policies. These include actions like raising interest rates because of an unrelated event. Also, banks may raise the chances of a late payment by changing monthly payment dates for credit cards.
According to a survey, 82% of Americans think credit cards provide a valuable service. But a majority, 58%, say they do not trust credit card companies. And three out of four think the government should regulate the industry more closely. Three out of four people feel there is always some condition that makes a card less appealing than the company made in scared. And a little more than half say they have had a card that was not as good as they expected. But close to 80% say no one really reads the terms and conditions when they sign up for a credit card.

            <Text><![CDATA[Most American students go to traditional public schools. There are about 88,000 public schools all over the US. Some students attend about 3000 independent public schools called charter schools.
	Charter schools are self-governing. Private companies operate some charter schools. They are similar in some ways to traditional public schools. They receive tax money just as other public schools do. Charter schools must prove to local or state governments that their students are learning. These governments provide the schools with the agreement called a charter that permits them to operate.
	Charter schools are different because they do not have to obey most laws governing traditional public schools. Local, state or federal governments cannot tell them what to teach. Each school can choose its own goals and decide the ways it wants to reach them. Class size is usually smaller than in traditional public schools.
	The Bush Administration strongly supports charter schools as a way to re-organize public schools that are failing to educate students. But some education agencies and unions oppose charter schools. One teachers’ union has just made public the results of the first national study comparing the progress of students in traditional schools and charter schools.
	The American Federation of Teachers criticized the government’s delay in releasing the results of the study, which is called the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Union education experts say the study shows that charter school students performed worse on math and reading tests than students in regular public schools.
	Some experts say the study is not a fair look at charter schools because students in those schools have more problems than students in traditional schools. Other education experts say the study results should make charter school officials demand improved student progress.

            <Text><![CDATA[BERLIN （AP） ---A tiger escaped its enclosure at Cologne Zoo in western Germany on Saturday and killed a female keeper before being shot dead by the zoo's director, police said．
The tiger slipped through a passage between the enclosure and a neighboring storage building, where it fatally attacked the 43-year-old keeper, said police spokesman Stefan Kirchner．
"It appears the gate wasn't properly shut," Kirchner told The Associated Press．
The zoo was evacuated and a SWAT （特警） team was called in, police said．But before it arrived the zoo's director managed to kill the tiger by climbing onto the storage building and shooting it through a skylight using a rifle．
Kirchner said it was unlikely that members of the public had witnessed the incident, "This is the darkest day of my life," the zoo's director, Theo Pagel, was quoted as saying by Cologne newspaper Express．
The paper said on its website that the Siberian tiger was a 4-year-old male called tltai that came to Cologne Zoo from an animal park in England．In November it fathered three cubs with a 7-year-old Siberian tiger called Hanya, according to the zoo's website．
Police said the zoo reopened after Saturday's incident, which occurred around noon．However, a planned late-night opening of the zoo has been canceled．
Cologne Zoo is one of the oldest in Germany．It was founded in 1860 and houses some 10,000 animals comprising more than 700 different species．

            <Text><![CDATA[For centuries, the body’s blood has been linked closely with the emotions. People who show no human emotions or feelings, are said to be cold-blooded killer. For example, the police are searching for a cold-blooded killer. He seems to kill for no reason,and no emo-tion,as if taking someone’s life as nothing.
Cold can affect other parts of the body. The expression“get cold feet” has nothing to do with cold or your feet . The expression means being afraid to do something you have de-cided to do .For example, you agree to be president of an organization. But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned,and all the work of the organization will be youre re-sponsibility. You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation.
The expression“give someone the cold shoulder” probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone,instesd of speaking to him face to face. You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you. Or, to someone who has lied about you to others.
A cold fish is not a fish. It is a person. But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemo-tional and shows no love or warmth. A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone. Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted. Now a cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy. Several popular songs in recent years were abut cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feelings,broke the hearts of their lovers.
“Out in the cold”means not getting something that everybody else got. A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise-he was left out in the cold. And it is not a pleasant place to be.

            <Text><![CDATA[In 1826, a Frenchman named Niepce needed pictures for his business. But he was not a good artist. So he invented a very simple camera. He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his yard. That was the first photograph.
The next important date in the history of photography was 1837. That year, Daguerre, another French, took a picture of his studio. He used a new kind of camera and a different process. In his pictures, you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest details. This kind of photograph was called a daguerreotype. 
　 Soon, other people began to use Daguerre’s process. Travelers brought back daguerreotypes from all around the world. People photographed famous buildings, cities and mountains. 
　 In about 1840, the process was improved. Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. The process was not simple. The photographers had to carry lots of films and processing equipment. But this did not stop the photographers, especially in the United States. After 1840s daguerreotype artists were popular in most cities. 
　 Mathew Brady was a well - known American photographer. He took many pictures of famous people. The pictures were unusual because they were very life - like and full of personality（个性）. 
　 Brady was also the first preson to take pictures of war. His 1862 Civil War pictures showed dead soldiers and ruined cities. They made the war seem more real and more terrible. 
　 In the 1880s, new inventions began to change photography… Photographers could buy films ready made in rolls（卷）. So they did not have to make the film themselves. Also, they did not have to process the film immediately. They could bring it back to their studios and develop it later meaning that they did not have to carry lots of equipment. And finally, the invention of the small handheld camera made photography less expensive. 
　 With the small camera, anyone could be a photographer. People began to use cameras just for fun. They took pictures of their families, friends and favorite places. They called these pictures “snapshot”. 
　 Photographs became very popular in newspapers in the 1890s. Soon magazines and books also used documentary photographs. These pictures showed true events and people. They were much more real than drawing. 
　 Photography also turned into a form of art by the end of the 10th century. Some photographs were not just copies of the real world. They showed ideas and feelings, like other art forms.

            <Text><![CDATA[  From a very early age,some children exhibit better self-control than others.Now,a new study that began with about 1,000 children in New Zealand has tracked how a child’s low self-control can predict poor health, money troubles and even a criminal record in their adult years.
   Researchers have been studying this group of children for decades now .They observed the level of self-control the youngsters displayed. Parents,teachers, even the kids them-selves,scored the youngsters on measures like“acting before thinking” and “Persistence in reaching goals.”
   The study led by Moffitt of Duke University and colleagues followed 1,000 children from birth to age 32 in Dunedin,New Zealand.
   “The children who had the lowest self-control when they were age three to ten, later on had the most health problems in their 30s,” Moffitt said, “and they had the worst financial situation,They were more likely to have a criminal record and to be raising a child as a sin-gle parent on a very low income.” Moffitt explained that self-control problems were widely observed, and weren’t just a feature of a small group of misbehaving kids.
Moffitt said it’s still unclear why some children have better self-control than others, though she said other resesrchers have found that it’s mostly a learned behavior,with relatively little genetic influence.But good self-control can be set to run in families because children with good self-control are more likely to grow up to be healthy and prosperous parents.But the good news,Moffitt said,is that self-control can be taught by parents,and through school curricula that have been shown to be effective.

            <Text><![CDATA[Most American students go to traditional public schools. There are about 88,000 pub-lic schools all over the US. Some students attend about 3000 independent public schools called charter schools.
Charter schools are self-governing.Private companies operate some charter schools.They are similar in some ways to traditional public schools.They receive tax money just as other public schools do. Charter schools must prove to local or state governments that their students are learning.These governments provide the schools with the agreement called a charter that permits them to operate.
Charter schools are different because they do not have to obey most laws governing tra-ditional public schools.Local,state or federal governments cannot tell them what to teach. Each school can choose its own goals and decide the ways it wants to reach them.Class size is usually smaller than in traditional public schools.
The Bush Administration strongly supports charter schools as a way to re-organize pub-lic schools that are failing to educate students.But some education agencies and unions op-pose charter schools.One teachers’ union has just made public the results of the first nation-al study comparing the progress of students in traditional schools and charter schools.
The American Federation of Teachers criticized the government’s delay in releasing the results of the study,which is called the National Assessment of Educational Progress.U-math education experts say the study shows that charter school students performed worse on math and reading tests the students in regular public schools. 
Some experts say the students is not a fair look at charter schools, because students in those schools have more problems than students in traditional schools.Other education experts say the study results should make charter school officials demand improved student progress.

            <Text><![CDATA[   “Our aim is to take our art to the world and make people undertand what it is to move.”said David Belle,the founder of parkour(跑酷）。
     Do you love running?It is a good exercise,yet many people find it boring .But what if making your morning jog a creative one?Like jumping from walls and over gaps,and ground rolls?Just like the James Bond in the movie Casino Royale?Bond jumps down from a roof to a windowsill and then runs several blocks over obstacles on the way. It is just because of  Bond's wonderful performances that the sport has become popular worldwide.
Yes,that's parkour, an extreme street sport aimed at moving from one point to anoth-er as quickly as possible, getting over all the obstacles in the path using only the abilities of the human body .Parkour is considered an extreme sport.As its participants dash around a city ,they may jump over fences,run up walls and even move from rooftop to rooftop.
Parkour can be just as exciting and charming as it sounds ,but its participants see park-our much more than that.
Overcoming all the obstacles on the course and in life is part of the philosophy(理念）behind parkour.This is the same as life.You must determine your destination,go straight,jump over all the barriers as if in parkour and never fall back from them in your life, to reach the destination successfully.A parkour lover said,“I love parkour because its philosophy has become my life, my way to do everything.”
Another philosophy we've learnt from parkour is freedom. It can done by anyone, at any time, anywhere in the world. It is a kind of expression of trust in yourself that you earn energy and confidence.
